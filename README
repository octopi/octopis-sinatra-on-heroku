Forked from scottmotte's [sinatra-heroku-cedar-template](https://github.com/scottmotte/sinatra-heroku-cedar-template). This setup includes support for erb views and MongoDB. 

## MongoDB
Locally, `mongod` must be running on port 27017 by default. The sample code connects to the `test` local database with a `testCollection`.

On Heroku, this is equipped to us MongoLab. Use:

    heroku addons:add mongolab:sandbox

To work with the supplied code, a `testCollection` needs to exist with one document that has `{"foo": "bar"}`.

If your application doesn't require a database, you can remove all references to MongoDB.
